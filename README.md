### Why I like the duo Marten - Postgres
First of all, Postgres is a rock solid database and runs on all platforms.
Marten allows, in a core clr .Net app to handover a POCO to the database with no additional ceremony whatsoever. 
That's true elegance. Full Stop :)

### Clean DI
The project is a good starting point for a full PostGres/Marten/WebApi based backend with clean DI based on autofac.

###
This project uses preview3 of dotnet core clr 1.1.
Make sure you have installed this sdk.
